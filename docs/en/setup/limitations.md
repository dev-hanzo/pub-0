title: Limitations
---

- Obviously, no obsidian's plugin will work. Only obsidian's plugin provided with an API can be converted, as Dataview (converted in simple markdown) for example.
- No graph view
- Mkdocs and Material Mkdocs doesn't support inline tags, and you will lose link in these tags. See [custom and tags attributes](../Template/customization.md#custom-and-tags-attributes) for more information.
- Nested tags are not supported
